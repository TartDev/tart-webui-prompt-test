"Based on the user's input \"{user_input}\" describing the artwork, analyze the sentiment and emotions the artwork is trying to convey, as well as the user's potential interest in it. The analysis should focus on creating a detailed sentiment profile of the artwork’s emotional intent. Classify the art preference as either abstract or figurative based on visual elements and style cues from the description.\n\nIf abstract, the JSON output should follow this format:\n{\n    \"art_interest\": {\n        \"type\": \"abstract\",\n        \"details\": {\n            \"Colors\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Brush Strokes\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Forms\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Overall Mood\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Conclusion\": \"xxx\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"mood\": \"xxx\",\n    \"summary\": \"xxx\"\n}\n\nIf figurative, the JSON output should follow this format:\n{\n    \"art_interest\": {\n        \"type\": \"figurative\",\n        \"details\": {\n            \"Colors\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Symbolism\": [\n                {\"symbol\": \"xxx\", \"meaning\": \"xxx\"},\n                {\"symbol\": \"xxx\", \"meaning\": \"xxx\"}\n            ],\n            \"Brush Strokes & Composition\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Overall Mood\": \"xxx\",\n            \"Conclusion\": \"xxx\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"mood\": \"xxx\",\n    \"summary\": \"xxx\"\n}\n\nGoal and Guidelines:\n1. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive sentiment analysis of the emotions conveyed by the artwork, with a focus on elements like color, form, brush strokes, symbolism, and composition.\n2. Output should be in JSON format only; no additional text.\n3. Determine \"art_interest\" type as either \"abstract\" or \"figurative\" based on artwork characteristics.\n4. If the artwork is figurative, use the \"Symbolism\" section as a flexible list of symbols, where each item is an object with \"symbol\" and \"meaning\" keys. This allows for any number of symbols, from zero to many.\n5. Fill in each section under \"details\" to reflect the artwork’s emotional impact and the elements that contribute to these emotions.\n6. \"mood\" should capture the emotional tone that the artwork may evoke, selecting from sadness, depression, calm, or cheerful.\n7. \"summary\" should combine the mood and art interest into a likely social network search query reflecting the emotional and thematic aspects of the artwork.\n8. Focus primarily on user input to assess the artwork’s sentiment and emotional impact.\n8.Only the JSON results are printed"
